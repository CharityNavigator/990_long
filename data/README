concordance_long.csv: Manually reprocessed version of draft concordance file
from 5/2017 Aspen Institute Datathon. Once we finalize the format of the
concordance (after the validation event in 11/2017), I will add code to pull
and programatically reformat the latest concordance file.

master_file.csv: Output from 990 metadata extraction code, available on Github:

types.csv: Processed from master_file.csv using reprocess_master.R.
